  <h2 class="m-5">New Zealand is home to over 200 native bird species,
    many of which are found nowhere else in the world.</h2>

  <p>Our birds are unique. They evolved in isolation for millions of
    years without any land-based mammalian predators.</p>

<p>When people arrived in New Zealand, they introduced predators like stoats,
  rats, cats, and possums, which prey on our native birds by eating adult birds,
  chicks, and eggs.</p>

<p>This means many of our native bird species are in trouble and today,
  68 percent of our birds are threatened with extinction.</p>

<p>At Forest & Bird, we receive a lot of enquiries from people who
  need help identifying a bird they have seen or heard. We have compiled a
  list of online resources that will help you to identify some of New
  Zealand's unique birdlife.</p>

                An average of 27 kiwi are killed by predators EVERY WEEK. That’s a population decline of around 1,400 kiwi every year (or 2%). At this rate, kiwi may disappear from the mainland in our lifetime. Just one hundred years ago, kiwi numbered in the millions.

                A single roaming dog can wipe out an entire kiwi population in a matter of days

                Approximately 20% of the kiwi population is under management.

                In areas under where predators are controlled, 50-60% of chicks survive. When areas are not under management 95% of kiwi die before reaching breeding age.

                Only 20% survival rate of kiwi chicks is needed for the population to increase.

                Proof of success – on the Coromandel, in the predator controlled area, the kiwi population is doubling every decade.

                <h3 class="text-dark">What’s so unusual? </h3>
                <p class="text-primary">
                Kiwi are flightless – their Latin species name is Apteryx, which means wingless. They belong to an ancient group of birds that can’t fly – the ratites. Because they can’t fly, how they arrived in New Zealand is not completely clear.

                Kiwi habits and physical characteristics are so like a mammal the bird is sometimes referred to as an honorary mammal. It has feathers like hair, nostrils at the end of its beak and an enormous egg.

                Most kiwi are nocturnal birds, like many of New Zealand’s native animals. Their calls pierce the forest air at dusk and dawn.

                Kiwi are omnivores. Discover what foods they find with their unusual beak.

                Even though kiwi are unusual enough, tall stories abound about the bird.</p>
